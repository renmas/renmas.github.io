           <summary><strong>What is the Low-Income Fare Trial (LIFT)?</strong></summary>
           <p>The <a href="https://thelabprojects.dc.gov/fare-subsidy" target="_blank">Low-Income Fare Trial (LIFT)</a> is a pilot program offering discounts on Metro and bus. Through a lottery, eligible residents will have a chance to get half-price discounts or free unlimited trips for nine months. If youâre eligible and you <a href="https://forms.beta.dc.gov/s3/LIFT-Online-Sign-Up-Form" target="_blank">enter the lottery</a> , you&rsquo;ll get one of the following:</p>

    <br>
    <details>
            <summary><strong>Why is DC Government offering the discounts by lottery?</strong></summary>
            <p>There are more eligible individuals than we have funding for in the pilot, and a lottery gives everyone a fair chance of getting a discount. We&rsquo;ll also be able to use this lottery to inform a study, called a <a class="c9" href="https://thelabprojects.dc.gov/randomized-evaluation" target="_blank">randomized evaluation</a>, that will help us see if LIFT &nbsp;actually impacts the way residents get around and their employment, income, family, health, and energy use. (Learn <a href="#id.dataprotection">how we&rsquo;ll protect participants&rsquo; data</a>.) The findings may help us make transit more affordable and encourage transit use in DC.</p>

    <a id="id.eligibility"></a> <h3>Eligibility</h3>
    <details>
        <summary><strong>Who is this program for?</strong></summary>
      <p>You may be eligible if <strong>all</strong> of the following are true :</p>
        <ul>
                <li>You live in the District of Columbia.</li>
                <li>You&rsquo;re between 18-64 years old.</li>
                <li>You are not currently employed by WMATA or the DC Government.</li>
                <li>Your household gets help paying for your utilities from the Department of Energy &amp; Environment (DOEE) or has in the past year. This means you received assistance from one or more of the following programs anytime since October 2020: </li>
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://www.frontdoor.dc.gov/liheap-and-udp" target="_blank">Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)</a> </li>
      <li> <a href="https://www.frontdoor.dc.gov/liheap-and-udp" target="_blank">Utility Discount Program (UDP)</a> </li>
      <li> <a href="https://www.frontdoor.dc.gov/criac" target="_blank">Clean Rivers Impervious Area Charge Residential Relief Program (CRIAC)</a> </li>
      <li> <a href="https://www.frontdoor.dc.gov/community-solar" target="_blank">Solar for All</a> </li>
    </ul>
      <li>You&rsquo;re not personally receiving a senior, student, or disability discount on transit including the <a href="https://www.wmata.com/fares/reduced.cfm" target="_blank">Free or Reduced Fare Program</a> for seniors and people with disabilities, <a href="https://ddot.dc.gov/page/kids-ride-free-program" target="_blank">Kids Ride Free</a>, or <a href="https://ddot.dc.gov/page/adult-learner-transit-subsidy-program-faqs" target="_blank">Adult Learner Transit Subsidy</a>. It&rsquo;s okay if someone else in your household is receiving one of these discounts.</li>
    </ul>
    </details><br>
    <details>
            <summary><strong>Why do I need to be receiving utility assistance from DOEE to sign up for this program?</strong></summary>
    <ul>
      <li>We want to make it as easy as possible to sign-up. DOEE already verifies income for households receiving utility assistance, so you will not need to verify your income again. In this way, we&rsquo;ll decrease the paperwork you&rsquo;ll need to enter the lottery.</li>
      <li>Because LIFT is a temporary pilot, it has limited spots. The findings from LIFT can be used to shape future policies and programs that make transit more affordable for low-income residents, not just DOEE customers.</li>
    </ul>
    </details><br>
    <details>
            <summary><strong>Can more than one person in my household enter the lottery?</strong></summary>
        <p>Only one member per household can sign up for LIFT.</p>
    </details><br>
    <details>
            <summary><strong>I don&rsquo;t meet the eligibility requirements, but I still need help paying for transit. What should I do?</strong></summary>
            <p>If you are not eligible for LIFT, you may be eligible for other transit discounts, such as the <a href="https://www.wmata.com/fares/reduced.cfm" target="_blank">&nbsp;Free or Reduced Fare Program</a> for seniors and people with disabilities or the <a href="https://ddot.dc.gov/page/kids-ride-free-program" target="_blank">Kids Ride Free</a> and <a href="https://ddot.dc.gov/page/adult-learner-transit-subsidy-program-faqs" target="_blank">Adult Learner Transit Subsidy</a> for students.</p>

    <details>
            <summary><strong>Is there a deadline for signing up?</strong></summary>
            <p>Yes, spots in the lottery are limitedâplease enter the lottery by Friday, April 29, 2022. Because this program is a temporary pilot, we donât know yet if it will be offered again in the future.</p>

       <details>
               <summary><strong>I was selected to receive a $25 Visa gift card in the lottery but not a transit discount. What does that mean?</strong></summary>
    <ul>
      <li>This means that you can continue to pay for Metrobus, Metrorail, DC Circulator, and other regional bus partners how you normally would. Prices will remain the same.</li>
      <li>You will still receive a $25 Visa gift card for signing up. We may also mail you a SmarTrip card, at the address you provided during your sign up, to use during the study.</li>
      <li>We will use information about your use of transit and other services to help us shape future programs that make public transit more affordable. We may ask you to complete optional (paid) surveys.</li>

    <details>
            <summary><strong>I received a half-price discount in the lottery. What does that mean?</strong></summary>
            <ul>
      <li>This means you will get half off the normal price of any trip on Metrobus, Metrorail, DC Circulator, and other <a href="#id.regbuses">regional bus partners</a> for the nine months with this SmarTrip card. You can add value to this card as you normally would, but Metro will only charge you half of the usual price when you tap it. You can also add half-priced 7-day unlimited passes and 7-day regional bus passes to your card. The half-price discount applies even during peak hours.</li>
      <li>You will receive your discounted SmarTrip card in the mail, at the address you provided during your sign up. You will also receive a $25 Visa gift card for signing up.</li>
      <li>We will use information about your use of transit and other services to help us shape future programs that make public transit more affordable. We may ask you to complete optional (paid) surveys.</li>

You can immediately use this SmarTrip card to tap into metro stations and buses&ndash;you do not need to load it with transit value or other passes. The free fare applies even during peak hours.</li>
      <li>You will receive your discounted SmarTrip card in the mail, at the address you provided during your sign up. You will also receive a $25 Visa gift card for signing up.</li>

              <p>No, your LIFT SmarTrip card cannot be added to your phone through Apple Wallet or Google Pay. This means that you cannot tap into the metro or bus using your phone&ndash;you have to use your card.</p>

    <br>
    <details>
            <summary><strong>Can I sell my LIFT SmarTrip card?</strong></summary>

    </details>
    <br>
    <details>
            <summary><strong>Am I allowed to participate in other DC Government programs during LIFT?</strong></summary>
    
      <p>Your participation in LIFT does not affect the benefits and services you would normally receive from DOEE or other District agencies, but you are not eligible for LIFT if you personally receive a senior, disability, or student discount on Metro or bus. That includes the Free or Reduced Fare Program for seniors and people with disabilities or the Kids Ride Free and Adult Learner Transit Subsidy for students.</p>

Weâll look at the number and type of trips youâalong with everyone else who enters the lotteryâtake on transit to learn how the discounts impact the way you get around. We will ask you to answer optional surveys, and youâll be paid for your time. We may look at existing data from DC government and credit reporting agencies to see whether the discounts impact your employment, income, childrenâs outcomes, and use of healthcare and social services. All your records will remain confidential. </p>
